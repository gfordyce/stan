TODO items for Stan - G. Fordyce 2/26/09
----------------------------------------
- Move method definition into cpp files (compile dependencies whenever code is touched)
- Concept for scaling and sizing figures: hold down 's' while using
  scroll wheel to scale (thickness), or 'r' to resize figure up/down.
- Use scroll wheel to cycle up/down through frames in the FrameEditView
  while indexing through the FrameStripView. Would be nice to quickly see
  piece of animation at whatever rate you like. This may require that the
  FrameStripView be selected.
- Clean up test directory. There should only be one executable (test_runner). Move the
  remaining tests into cppunit format (test_XXXX.cpp/.h).
- Add some keyboard input to test creation of animation. Use 'd' to duplicate current frame.
  Need save and play functions. Up and down arrows to move back/forth through the frames.
- Break figure - At selected node. The selected node becomes the root of a new figure
  and all children become children of this new root node within the new figure. A
  nice effect may be to move the new figure over / down by some offset. Break tool (knife bitmap)
- Convert wxColour RGB into unsigned member of edge
- Invisible color - so you can have seemingly disconnected parts with invisible edge between them.

6/30/09:

- Design requirements for image handling:

      Use wxThumbnailBrowserDialog (built as separate library) to choose images.

      Display current image in Figure editor.

      Animation includes a table of images added:

      stan_image {
          int index_;
          wxString filename_;
          wxImage image_ptr_;
      }

      Edge of type image has an index into the above table.

- Metaframe types:

      Animation metadata such as background, rate, pause, etc... that effect the playback of an animation.

      Are displayed in the filmstrip with custom icon / drawing.

      When selected, the canvas would display a settings dialog to change the metadata properties.
