Multiplatform using boost, wxWidgets, and cmake.

6/1/09
------

Current build depends on:

cppunit-1.12.1
boost_1_38 (serialization, threads)
wxWidgets-2.8.10
cmake-2.6 (Linux)

Due to strange runtime issues with boost libraries on Windows when built via CMake, the Windows build is not a VS project under build/msvc8. Hope to figure this how someday and get back to CMake for both (that is the purpose of a cross-platform make, right?).

Enjoy.
