TODO items for Stan - G. Fordyce 2/26/09
----------------------------------------
- Concept for scaling and sizing figures: hold down 's' while using
  scroll wheel to scale (thickness), or 'r' to resize figure up/down.
- Use scroll wheel to cycle up/down through frames in the FrameEditView
  while indexing through the FrameStripView. Would be nice to quickly see
  piece of animation at whatever rate you like. This may require that the
  FrameStripView be selected.
- Clean up test directory. There should only be one executable (test_runner). Move the
  remaining tests into cppunit format (test_XXXX.cpp/.h).
- Add some keyboard input to test creation of animation. Use 'd' to duplicate current frame.
  Need save and play functions. Up and down arrows to move back/forth through the frames.
